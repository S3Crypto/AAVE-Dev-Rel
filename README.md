# AAVE-Dev-Rel
AAVE Developer Relations Technical Assessment.
Main code can be found within contracts/main.sol.
Code will probably not run as I could not get Truffle / Web3JS / Fuji to all connect properly in my developer environment.
Spent all Saturday night trying to debug and setup a working dev environment. Gave up and wrote Suedo-code, hopefully it is somewhat similar to the real implementation.
